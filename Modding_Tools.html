With APK Editor you can choose between two types of editing: FULL EDIT, which lets you rebuild files from an APK; and SIMPLE EDIT, which lets you replace files inside an APK. The first is a much more complex and strenuous process, while the second type of editing can be done much more easily.

Regardless of which type you choose, you'll quickly realize that it's extremely easy to edit any aspect of an APK. You can change an app's background image, add or remove languages, or even delete permissions. Everything depends on how skilled you are.

APK Editor is a... tricky app. When used well it can bring you lots of joy, but if used poorly... not so much. In any case, you can find some examples and advice for using the app correctly on the app's help page.",

A powerful debugging app for Android. Developer Assistant makes debugging native Android apps as simple as debugging web pages using Chrome’s Developer Tools. It allows you to inspect the View hierarchy, verify Layout, Style, preview Translations and more. Everything can be done directly from the mobile device. Works for most Android apps.
Developer Assistant uses a mixture of official APIs and sophisticated heuristics in order to show at runtime more than possible for other tools. It’s tailored to increase productivity of professionals like Developers, Testers, Designers and Power Users in their day to day geeky tasks.
Developer Assistant is… right, the assistant app, you can invoke it at any time by a simple gesture like long pressing the home button.
🔴What's New 
✔ The Element tab presents matching XML resources like layouts, styles, colors, drawables (possible thanks to the vastly improved heuristics which allow Developer Assistant to understand inspected apps better than before).
✔ Assist app setup wizard has been refreshed, covers cases related to the Android 10 gestures and custom button mappings seen on selected devices.
