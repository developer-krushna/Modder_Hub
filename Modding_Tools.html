Changelog:
V3
- Resources decrypted
- Frida's JS is also decrypted, and run through a utility that makes it (beautiful) (thanks to my friend Timur for the hint, I won't leave links to it)
- Frida now starts not immediately, but only after the launch of the application itself, the JS launch delay has also been changed
- There is a lot of new information in the license agreement, I advise you to read it + a mod validation system was created, because there were already those who very clumsily began to appropriate the mod to themselves
