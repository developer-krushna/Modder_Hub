Changelog:
V3
- Resources decrypted
- Frida's JS is also decrypted, and run through a utility that makes it "beautiful";) (thanks to my friend Timur for the hint, I won't leave links to it)
- Frida now starts not immediately, but only after the launch of the application itself, the JS launch delay has also been changed
- There is a lot of new information in the license agreement, I advise you to read it + a mod validation system was created, because there were already those who very clumsily began to appropriate the mod to themselves
by @JagKubarev

V2
- Fixed a bug with resetting VIP status after restarting the application for regular (non-VIP) accounts (previously because of this, after restarting, you had to update the account status).
- Fixed a bug with installing plugins for real VIP users (for normal users, it's best to log into an account with a real VIP, install plugins, and log into your regular account).
- Fixed Arm加固 fake protection detection.
- Another small fix in assets/ApkUnpacker to make the app run faster.
- Substitution of the V1 signature for the BIN signature, although the application continues to be signed by my private key)
by @JagKubarev

V1
- Removed most of the dead code from classes.dex by @RojgaarAadmi
- Removed unused files from assets/ApkUnpacker archive + raised minSDK to android 6.0, since the hack will not work on lower versions of android (due to the CNFIX signature verification hook) by @JagKubarev
Hy Bin if you are reading it then we expect some improvement in protection
and Happy Marriage Life , Count this as your Marriage Gift
All Other Modders are allowed to mod it further if you wish (keep credit please)
Finally Thanks To our lovely Frida & Radare2",
